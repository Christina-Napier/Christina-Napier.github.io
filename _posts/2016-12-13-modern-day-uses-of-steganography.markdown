<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Modern Day Uses of Steganography</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steganography and the act of obfuscation or data hiding can be found to be used in many other information security related disciplines.&nbsp; Steganography may be a solution to sending data when secure lines are not readily available, especially in the instance when data can be intercepted. It is intended that the data can be sent between two parties without arousing suspicion, as opposed to encryption where this may attract attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Some uses of Steganography:</strong> &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Concerns of Future Use</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terrorist factions such as Al-Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah are some that have been suspected of the use of Steganography. Using Steganography to embed maps and communication to their followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Four basic concepts as defined (Grabosky, P. &amp; Smith 1998; Grabosky &amp; Smith 2002) show how modern technology can be embraced to facilitate terrorist activities &ldquo;Coordinating and planning criminal activities; marketing and distribution of illicit services or products; sustaining the organisational, structure; and obstruction of law enforcement investigations&rdquo; (Grabosky, P. &amp; Smith 1998) Steganography can have a part to play in each of these areas. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Technology may have been previously associated with western lifestyle ideology and therefore previous generations of Islamic based factions of terrorism may have distanced themselves from technological platforms to carry out tasks, of which has slowed their progress within this area. However with modern day technology becoming further ingrained into society it becomes apparent how it can be used within planning and co-ordination, radicalisation and propaganda, fund raising and intelligence gathering. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />The cyber domain is indeed the new battleground for such factions, it has actually been on the radar of activists and non-conformists of the political ideal for some time. As Denning describes in her sequel to her 2001 report, &ldquo;A View of Cyberterrorism Five Years Later&rdquo;, 2007.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first reported incident of this nature took place in 1997 when an offshoot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) claimed responsibility for &ldquo;suicide email bombings&rdquo; against Sri Lankan embassies over a two-week period. Calling themselves the Internet Black Tigers, the group swamped Sri Lankan embassies with about 800 emails a day.&rdquo; (Denning 2007)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are now eighteen years ahead since this time, and a new generation of potential perpetrators have developed within a modern culture that inherently encompasses technology. Previous generations non adaptation to technology may have slowed the use, but with the speed at which technology is spreading around the world, alongside mobile technology it will not be long before more incidents are involving complex methods of data hiding. The irony is that would we actually know without hindsight that the progression of use of Steganography even exist; as it is something which has the intention of hiding its even existence. Also If the technical adeptness is not apparent, the finance to pay for these services is there. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With advances in technology it brings new formats and channels in which Steganography can be applied. There is the possibility of Steganography within games consoles as per (Podhradsky et al. 2012) investigations; they were able to upload and host on the system a carrier file as part of the Microsoft Xbox 360 theme modifications capabilities. <br />With the use of software such as 'Invisible secrets' (East-Tec 2014)&nbsp; to carry out Steganography, 'Modio' (GameTuts 2015) to modify and upload the image and 'wxPirs' (gael360 2006)&nbsp; to extract and download the image; it is possible to gain an intact carrier file with its secret embedded message. Unfortunately, Digital Forensics technology is continually having to progress to keep up with these technological advancements.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Reports have been previously in the news detailing how terrorists have communicated using videos as a cover file. Computer forensic experts from the German Federal Criminal Police (BKA) discovered a pornographic video file name &ldquo;kick-ass.mov&rdquo;, when they arrested a suspected Al-Qaeda member in Berlin, 2011. They had found over 100 files detailing operations and plans within this video; such as &ldquo;Lessons Learned&rdquo;, &ldquo;Report on Operations&rdquo; and &ldquo;Future works&rdquo;. Fortunately for them it was not encrypted (Gallagher 2012).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;<br />This could have been uploaded to one of the 4.2 possible pornographic sites on the internet. Thus making the carrier files extremely accessible to those who know where to look, and a needle in the haystack operation for others. (Gallagher 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />With extremists now becoming more technologically proficient, covert data is no longer reserved for espionage cases. It is felt since encryption and monitoring has become a focus of attention, that steganographic practices may become more mainstream to those who wish to preserve privacy or thwart attempts of detection. (Gallagher 2012)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Illustration 2: Screen shot of Gallagher. S 2012 (Gallagher 2012) &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It is imperative that detection of such nefarious uses advances, not just for terrorist prevention but to also to protect data. Data ex-filtration is another result from using steganographic processes. Tripwire had released a recent report detailing that a fortune 500 company had become victim to a campaign.&nbsp; <br />The ongoing attack; where data had bypassed firewalls and Intrusion detection systems, had used video based Steganography. The videos which (were all the same), all carried different parts of sensitive data out of the company via a video upload site. It was this duplication which led to the alert and detection. (Westin 2014)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />It is not a new occurrence of Steganography being used for a data ex-filtration. It is not just for the exfiltration of data it has been used for either; it has been used in the past to help facilitate the act obfuscating the transmission and communication to command and control centres of attackers.&nbsp; There are some notable Advance Persistent Threats that have used Steganography, with this method to carry out malicious campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Illustration 4: Screen shot of Westin Report (Westin 2014) &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Some other malware variants that have been found are: ZeusVM: which utilises hiding malware configuration inside JPG images, VAWTRAK hides configuration file in a remote favicon image file, FakeReg hides malware settings in the app icon. However it isn&rsquo;t just images that are being used an example is VBKlip hides data within the HTTP protocol targeting specifically Polish bank accounts. Obfuscation of activities here is a key ability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give an insight as to the impact of such malware, one of the oldest, popular infiltrations is the case of Operation Shady Rat which was made notable by Mcafee in 2011.</p>
